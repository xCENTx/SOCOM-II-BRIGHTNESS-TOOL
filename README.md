# SOCOM-II-BRIGHTNESS-TOOL

Brightness Adjustment Trainer for SOCOM II U.S. Navy SEALs [PCSX2]

Originally created to fix the brightness issues on some maps when the Render Fix is enabled. 
This was made open source for the whole Socom Community. However, as soon as making it open source Justin OneUp changed his mind on the whole thing and decided that he would ban players for using it. Due to this , it is strongly recommended that you do not use this on the PS Rewired Service
